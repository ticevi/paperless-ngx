            arch image, which means some "untagged" images need to exist still.

            Ok, bear with me, these are annoying.

            Our images are multi-arch, so the manifest is more like a pointer to a sha256 digest.
            These images are untagged, but pointed to, and so should not be removed (or every pull fails).

            So for each image getting kept, parse the manifest to find the digest(s) it points to.  Then
            remove those from the list of untagged images.  The final result is the untagged, not pointed to
            version which should be safe to remove.

            Example:
                Tag: ghcr.io/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx:1.7.1 refers to
                    amd64: sha256:b9ed4f8753bbf5146547671052d7e91f68cdfc9ef049d06690b2bc866fec2690

                each of which appears as untagged image, but isn't really.

                So from the list of untagged packages, remove those digests.  Once all tags which
                are being kept are checked, the remaining untagged packages are actually untagged
                with no referrals in a manifest to them.
